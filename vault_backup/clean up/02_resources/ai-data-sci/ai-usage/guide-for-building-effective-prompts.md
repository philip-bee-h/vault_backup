| 1     | Task          | **Paramount.** Begin with a clear action verb to define the primary goal.                       | Start with verbs like "generate", "analyze", "write". Clearly state the desired outcome.                           |

### Step-by-Step Guide for Building Effective Prompts

#### 1. Start with the Task

- **Priority**: The task is paramount. Begin your prompt with a clear action verb (e.g., generate, analyze, write) to define the primary goal.
- **Clarity is Key**: Explicitly state the desired outcome to ensure the AI understands what you're asking for.

#### 2. Add Relevant Context

- **Order Matters**: After establishing the task, introduce context to refine the AI's focus. Context adds depth, making the task more understandable.
- **Balancing Act**: Provide enough background to inform the task without overloading details. Consider the user's background, what success looks like, and the environmental factors at play.

#### 3. Incorporate Exemplars (Examples)

- **Enhancing Quality**: Following context, exemplars can significantly improve output by offering concrete examples or frameworks for the AI to mimic.
- **Selective Use**: Not every prompt requires exemplars, but when used, they should directly support the task and context.

#### 4. Specify the Persona

- **Guiding the AI's Voice**: Persona comes next in importance. Define who you want the AI to embody in its response, whether a specific role, expertise level, or even a well-known individual.
- **Customization**: Adjusting the persona can tailor the AI's approach and language to your specific scenario, adding a layer of personalization.

#### 5. Choose the Format

- **Visualize the Outcome**: Think about how you want the response to be structured. This could include specifying the format as a table, list, paragraphs, or any other layout.
- **Precision**: Clearly outlining the desired format helps ensure the output meets your expectations, making it easier to use or present.

#### 6. Determine the Tone

- **Last but Not Least**: Tone adjusts the AI's language style to match the mood or attitude you're aiming for, such as professional, friendly, enthusiastic, or cautious.
- **Adaptability**: While tone is the final component to consider, it's crucial for setting the right impression, especially in communication scenarios.

### Integrating the Components

When constructing your prompt, it's essential to recognize the hierarchy of these components. Starting with the task ensures the AI has a clear directive. Adding context then narrows down the AI's focus area, making its responses more targeted and relevant. Exemplars, persona, format, and tone further refine the output, enhancing its quality and suitability for your needs.

#### Crafting a Comprehensive Prompt

"Given the task of notifying your boss about the successful launch of a new product, start by clearly stating the update as your main objective. Include key context such as the product's name, the achieved milestones, and why they matter. If applicable, reference a similar announcement as an exemplar for structure or content. Specify you're writing as a senior marketing manager to shape the persona. Request a structured email format, with sections for a TL;DR, background, and results. Lastly, choose a tone that balances professionalism with genuine excitement."
