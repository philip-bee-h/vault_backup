I am creating a productivity system for myself using some aspects from Carl Pullein Time sector system and a few others . Can you review the data I am compiling below and help me generate a instructional guide for creating and managing this system please include the schedule as well



### How to make this all work

- **Start with a Daily Review:** Each morning, briefly review your tasks and emails to identify urgent issues and requests. This aligns with a philosophy of prioritizing tasks based on their importance and urgency.

- **Categorize Emails Quickly:** Use your Areas of Focus as a guide to quickly categorize emails into actionable categories (e.g., Troubleshooting, Device Management, etc.). This will help you prioritize and respond more efficiently.

- **Flexible Task Blocks:** Instead of scheduling your entire day with specific tasks, allocate blocks of time for different types of work. For instance, set aside time for urgent troubleshooting, project work, and administrative tasks, but remain flexible about which specific tasks you'll tackle during these blocks.

- **Prioritize Flexibility:** Given the fluid nature of your work, it's important to keep some parts of your day unscheduled for unexpected tasks or issues that arise.

- **Use a 'Catch-All' Time Slot:** Reserve a block of time daily or weekly for tasks that weren't planned but need attention. This could be for following up on requests, addressing unplanned issues, or progressing projects.

- **Weekly Review:** At the end of the week, review your tasks and projects. This is a good time to adjust your priorities, check your progress, and plan for the upcoming week.

- **Leverage Technology:** Since you specialize in device management and are adept with tools like Microsoft Bookings, MECM, and Jamf Pro, leverage these tools to streamline your task management and scheduling.

- **Set Clear Boundaries:** While it's important to be flexible, also set boundaries to protect your time for high-priority tasks and projects. For instance, designate certain hours as 'focus time' for project work, during which you minimize interruptions.

- **Delegate When Possible:** If there are tasks that can be handled by others in your team or department, don't hesitate to delegate. This will help you focus on areas that require your specific expertise.

- **Regular Check-Ins with Yourself:** Throughout the day, take brief moments to reassess your priorities and adjust your focus as needed.


### Tags - Categories - Areas of Focus

To effectively organize your tasks within the time blocks outlined in the schedule, you can use specific tags in your task manager. These tags will help categorize tasks and align them with the designated time blocks. Here are some tag suggestions based on the discussed schedule:

1. **#Urgent**: For tasks that require immediate attention, especially during your morning review and troubleshooting blocks.
2. **#TechnicalSupport**: For tasks related to addressing technical issues and providing support.
3. **#DeviceManagement**: For tasks involving the management and maintenance of devices.
4. **#ProjectWork**: For tasks that fall under ongoing projects or initiatives you are leading.
5. **#AdminTasks**: For administrative duties, including process management and organizational tasks.
6. **#Documentation**: For tasks involving the creation or updating of documentation and knowledge sharing.
7. **#StrategicPlanning**: For tasks related to long-term planning, strategy development, and high-level decision-making.
8. **#ProfessionalDevelopment**: For activities related to learning, training, and skill enhancement.
9. **#CatchAll**: For unplanned tasks that arise and need to be accommodated within your schedule.
10. **#WeeklyReview**: For tasks related to reviewing your week, planning ahead, and assessing progress.
11. **#Emails**: Specifically for tasks that involve managing and responding to emails.
12. **#FlexTime**: A versatile tag for tasks that can be moved or adjusted based on the day's demands.



### Folder Structure in Task Manager
---

- **This Week**
- **Next Week**
- **This Month**
- **Next Month**
- **LongTerm**
- **Routine**

**How It Works:** Allocate your tasks to the appropriate Time Sector, including a dedicated sector for recurring "Routines." Focus on the relevant sector based on your current work mode. By doing so, you ensure priorities are managed effectively, and all tasks, including routine ones, are addressed.

- **Do you need to do it this week?** Add a day you will do it and put it in this week's time sector.
- **Can it wait until next week?** Put it in next week's time sector.
- **Are you not sure yet?** Put it in this month's time sector.
- **Can it wait until next month?** Put it in next month's time sector.
- **Does it not need to be done until later in the year?** Put it in your long-term time sector.
- **Is it a recurring task?** Add it to the "Routines" sector.

### "Routines" Sector Details
---

- **Purpose:** For tasks that recur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. These are tasks critical for maintaining ongoing operations and personal habits.
- **Examples:** Daily system checks, weekly team meetings, monthly reports, routine data backups.
- **Management:**
    - **Set Recurrence:** Use your task manager's recurrence feature to schedule these tasks.
    - **Regular Review:** At the start of your day or week, review the "Routines" sector to stay aware of these recurring tasks.
    - **Prioritization:** While these tasks are routine, some may be more critical than others. Prioritize within this sector as necessary.

### End of day check list 
---
The Golden 10
Use this checklist at the end of your day to build
momentum into your goal achievement and life's purpose.

• Process all your inboxes
• Review your calendar for tomorrow.
• Schedule your focus time
• What work do you want to accomplish tomorrow? (lay out Focus 10)
(Schedule that work in your calendar)
• What two objectives will you make tomorrow?
• What can I do to make progress on my goals?

This end of day checklist should take no more than ten minutes. 

### Focus 10

How to use this workflow

As part of your Golden Ten evening routine, use this workflow to prioritise what you want to accomplish tomorrow.

**1 Your Two Objectives**

Choose two tasks from your daily list for tomorrow that would have the biggest positive impact on your goals or projects. These tasks must be completed—no excuses!

**2 Your Daily Focus**

What will you focus on tomorrow? This could be a project, a hobby, your family. Anything you want to put your attention on for the day. A good example would be if you have a deadline coming up and you need to spend some focused time on it. Make that your focus for the day so that in between doing your tasks this one focus will be done.

**3 The Daily Eight**

These are the eight tasks you would like to get done tomorrow, but it would not be the end of the world if you didn’t manage to do them. They are priorities, but not top priorities.

**4 The Next Actions**

These are the very next tasks from the projects in your active projects list. Most days you will not get round to these, but if you do have spare time at the end of the day these are great tasks to get done because they keep all your active projects moving forward.

The reason the number of tasks are kept to a maximum of ten is so you will have time throughout the day to handle any interruptions that come your way. Of course, the goal is to keep the list as short as you possibly can. If you only have one objective and one task on your daily eight, that’s fantastic. It means you are focusing on what is important.

These lists do not include your daily routines. These are kept separate as they do not move your life further forward and just have to be done on specific days, often at specific times.

The whole purpose of this workflow is to keep you focused on what is important to you, your development and your priorities. If you find your lists are filling up with the priorities of other people (your boss, parents, partner or friends) then you need to re- evaluate what is important to you.
