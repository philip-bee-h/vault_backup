Navigating deeply nested directories from the terminal can indeed become cumbersome. To streamline this process, especially when dealing with paths like those in your Obsidian vault, you can use a combination of command line tricks and shell features. Here are some practical solutions to make navigating those deep paths quicker and more efficient:

### 1. Use Tab Completion
- **Tab completion**: Simply start typing the beginning of your directory name and press `Tab` to auto-complete the directory name. If there are multiple directories that start with the same letters, you might need to type a few more characters before pressing `Tab` again.

### 2. Create Aliases for Common Paths
- **Shell aliases**: If you find yourself frequently accessing certain directories, you can create aliases in your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.). For example:
  ```sh
  alias obsidian='cd ~/path/to/notes/obsidian/vault'
  ```
  After adding this alias, you just need to type `obsidian` in your terminal to jump directly to your specified path.

### 3. Use Symbolic Links
- **Symbolic links (symlinks)**: Create a symlink to a deep directory from a more accessible location. For example:
  ```sh
  ln -s ~/path/to/notes/obsidian/vault ~/Desktop/vault
  ```
  Now, you can access your vault directly from the Desktop directory or any location you choose for the symlink.

### 4. Utilize `pushd` and `popd`
- **Directory stack**: Use `pushd` to navigate to directories and `popd` to return to the previous directory. This is useful for moving between locations without having to retype long paths.
  - `pushd /path/to/directory` pushes the directory to the stack and navigates to it.
  - `popd` returns you to the previous directory.

### 5. Scripting
- **Custom scripts**: Write small shell scripts to navigate to specific directories or perform routine tasks within your Obsidian vault. For example:
  ```sh
  #!/bin/bash
  cd /path/to/obsidian/vault && ls
  ```
  Save this as `goto_vault.sh` and run it whenever you need to check the contents of your vault quickly.

### 6. Use `z` or `autojump`
- **Directory jumping tools**: Tools like `z` or `autojump` learn your most frequently accessed directories and allow you to jump to them with partial names. After a short learning period, you can navigate to frequently used directories with commands like `z vault`.

### 7. File Manager Integration
- **Terminal-based file managers**: Consider using terminal-based file managers like `ranger` or `nnn` for easy visual navigation through directories. These tools allow you to explore your filesystem with keyboard shortcuts.

### Conclusion
By leveraging these tips, you can significantly reduce the time and effort required to navigate through complex directory structures, like your Obsidian notes folder. Whether through shell aliases, symbolic links, directory stacking, custom scripts, directory jumping tools, or terminal-based file managers, there's a method that can fit your workflow and make working with your notes more enjoyable and efficient.

I chose a combination of using a script which is run by alias.

Here's a simple guide to creating a `goto_vault.sh` script, making it executable, and creating an alias for it in your `.bashrc` file using `nvim`.

### Step 1: Create the Script

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to a directory where you'd like to keep your script. For simplicity, let's use your home directory.
   ```
   cd ~
   ```
3. Create the script file with `nvim`:
   ```
   nvim goto_vault.sh
   ```

4. In the `nvim` editor, enter the following script. Replace `/path/to/notes/obsidian/vault` with the actual path to your Obsidian vault.
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   cd /path/to/notes/obsidian/vault
   ```
5. Save and exit `nvim`:
   - Press `Esc` to enter command mode.
   - Type `:wq` and press `Enter` to write the file and quit.

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

1. In your terminal, run the following command to make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x ~/goto_vault.sh
   ```

### Step 3: Create an Alias in `.bashrc`

1. Open your `.bashrc` file with `nvim`:
   ```
   nvim ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Scroll to the bottom of the file and add a new line for the alias. Replace `~/goto_vault.sh` with the full path if your script is not in your home directory.
   ```bash
   alias goto_vault='~/goto_vault.sh'
   ```
3. Save and exit `nvim`:
   - Press `Esc` to enter command mode.
   - Type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

### Step 4: Apply the Changes

1. To apply the changes made to your `.bashrc`, either restart your terminal session or source the `.bashrc` file with:
   ```
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Step 5: Use Your Alias

1. Now, whenever you want to navigate to your Obsidian vault directory, simply type `goto_vault` in your terminal, and you'll be taken directly to it.

### Summary

You've now created a simple script to navigate to your Obsidian vault, made it executable, and set up an alias in your `.bashrc` for easy access. Just by typing `goto_vault` in your terminal, you'll jump straight to your vault directory, streamlining your workflow.
