How do we handle restoring on ceph 

## Current State

- **User Requests Service** via:
    - RC Inbox
    - RDSS Inbox
    - ShareWell
    - Microsoft Teams
    - Workflow Forms
    - IT-Research Systems inbox
- **CET Team**:
    - Watches the inbox's
    - Manually creates a **Jira Ticket**
    - **Ticket Flow**:
        - If **CET** → Direct Assign
        - If **ACST** → Goes to a Pool > someone assigns to an Individual
- **Work Starts**:
	- ACST startes work
    - Communication by ACST happens through the **RC Inbox**
    - CET monitors inbox for responses
	    - Updates the ticket → Assigned Individual continues work
- **Issue**:
    - CET effectively acts as a **Helpdesk** for ACST, and all communication relies on them 
    - Creates a **Friction Point** between Users ↔ Support Staff
    - there is a big gap of potential time between service request being submitted and "first "




rc inbox to be ticket connector
