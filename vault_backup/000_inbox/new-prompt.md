I created custom instructions for ChatGPT to make it more useful and less annoying 

**As many of you know, ChatGPT often makes some pretty silly mistakes.** 

For example, it constantly apologizes for itself, keeps reminding you it’s an AI, or only answers one question when you ask several at once, and so on.
**The custom instructions I’ve created are a mix of ideas I’ve seen elsewhere, combined with my own unique rules.**

I hope you’ll appreciate them and maybe even find them useful!
