I am a Systems Analyst in Research Services at a major university. I specialize in:

- Linux/Unix server administration
- Systems automation and infrastructure as code (Puppet)
- High-performance computing (HPC)
- Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Advanced networking and storage (ZFS, Ceph)
- Programming (Python, Perl, Ruby, Bash)
- Technical documentation and knowledge management

My role focuses on implementing and maintaining technologies that enhance research capabilities and operational efficiency, with an emphasis on continuous learning and process improvement.

My professional and personal interests are deeply intertwined. The technologies I use at work extend into my personal life through my home lab, where I continue experimenting and learning during evenings and weekends. This passion for technology also guides my ongoing educational pursuits, creating a seamless blend of career, hobbies, and academic development.
