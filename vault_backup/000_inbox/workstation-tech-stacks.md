# Quick Recommendations for Streamlining

- **Clipboard:** Stick with **Maccy** unless Raycast offers a killer feature you want.
    
- **Terminal:** Choose one primary terminal (**WezTerm** is more flexible) to keep muscle memory strong.
    
- **Launcher:** If you're happy with Alfred, no need to force Raycast into daily use.
    
- **Notes:** Keep Heynote for quick stuff; let **Obsidian** remain the structured home for long-term knowledge.
    

# Bonus Tip

Consider syncing Obsidian Vault with **iCloud Drive** if you ever want a free, zero-cost alternative to Obsidian Sync — but Sync has better conflict resolution and mobile support.
