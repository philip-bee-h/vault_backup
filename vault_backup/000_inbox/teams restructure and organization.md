To create a **clean, simple, and uniform structure** for all three services (IDAS, HPC, and Storage), we can streamline and standardize the top-level folders across services. Keeping folder depth shallow ensures easy navigation while maintaining a consistent naming scheme.

### **Proposed Uniform Folder Structure**
Here’s a suggested structure to standardize across services:

```
/services/
├── idas/
│   ├── admin/               # Administrative tasks: purchases, utilization, MOU, etc.
│   ├── projects/            # Specific initiatives or upgrades
│   ├── documentation/       # Reference materials and SOPs
│   ├── resources/           # Shared images, presentations, etc.
│   ├── reports/             # Utilization reports or analytics
│   └── archive/             # Legacy content
├── hpc/
│   ├── admin/               # Administrative tasks: purchases, utilization, MOU, etc.
│   ├── projects/            # Specific initiatives or upgrades
│   ├── documentation/       # Reference materials and SOPs
│   ├── resources/           # Shared images, presentations, etc.
│   ├── reports/             # Utilization reports or analytics
│   └── archive/             # Legacy content
└── storage/
    ├── admin/               # Administrative tasks: purchases, utilization, MOU, etc.
    ├── projects/            # Specific initiatives or upgrades
    ├── documentation/       # Reference materials and SOPs
    ├── resources/           # Shared images, presentations, etc.
    ├── reports/             # Utilization reports or analytics
    └── archive/             # Legacy content
```

### **How Each Folder Is Used**
- **`admin/`**  
  - Centralizes operational and administrative files, such as purchases, MOUs, inventory tracking, and historical documents.
  
- **`projects/`**  
  - Houses specific initiatives like **Argon Head Migration** (HPC), **MIDAS upgrades** (IDAS), or **SSD expansion** (Storage).

- **`documentation/`**  
  - Stores reference documents, SOPs, and any manuals.

- **`resources/`**  
  - A catch-all for shared files like images, presentations, or channel photos.

- **`reports/`**  
  - For utilization reports, performance metrics, or analytics.

- **`archive/`**  
  - Holds legacy or completed projects/documents. Prefix "z_" is unnecessary if all archives go here.

### **Folder Naming Scheme**
To maintain uniformity, use **descriptive lowercase names with hyphens**:
- Avoid abbreviations unless absolutely necessary (e.g., "midas" is fine if widely understood).
- Keep names intuitive and focused on their purpose.

Examples:
- `admin/` subfolders:  
  - `purchases-and-quotes/`  
  - `inventory-tracking/`  
  - `mou/`

- `projects/` subfolders:  
  - `argon-head-migration/`  
  - `2023-hpc-expansion/`

- `resources/` subfolders:  
  - `channel-images/`  
  - `presentations/`

---

### **Advantages of This Structure**
1. **Uniformity Across Services:**  
   Each service has the same top-level structure, making it intuitive to navigate and manage.

2. **Balanced Depth:**  
   Top-level folders group content logically without overcomplicating the hierarchy.

3. **Scalability:**  
   Future additions can be slotted into existing categories without restructuring.

### **Service-Specific Examples**
**IDAS:**
```

├── projects/
│   └── midas-expansion/
├── documentation/
├── resources/
│   ├── channel-photos/
│   └── presentations/
├── reports/
├── archive/
```

**HPC:**
```
/hpc/
├── inventory/                  # Hardware and equipment tracking
│   ├── nodes/                  # Node-specific inventory details
│   ├── racks/                  # Rack layout and configuration
│   ├── peripherals/            # Cables, switches, and other accessories
│   └── tracking/               # Shipment tracking, asset tags, etc.
├── purchasing/                 # Financial records and purchasing documentation
│   ├── purchasing/             # General purchasing documents
│   ├── quotes/                 # Vendor quotes for HPC-related items
│   └── receiving/              # Receipts for purchased items
├── projects/                   # Specific initiatives or upgrades
│   ├── argon-head-migration/
│   └── 2023-hpc-expansion/
├── documentation/              # Reference materials and agreements
│   └── mou/                    # Memorandums of understanding
├── resources/                  # Shared assets
│   └── channel-images/
├── reports/                    # Analytical and operational reports
│   └── utilization-reports/
├── archive/                    # Legacy content

```

**Storage:**
```
/storage/
├── admin/
│   ├── purchases-and-quotes/
│   ├── inventory-tracking/
│   └── mou/
├── projects/
│   └── ssd-expansion/
├── documentation/
├── resources/
│   ├── channel-images/
│   └── presentations/
├── reports/
├── archive/
```

### Next Steps
- **Discuss File Naming:** Ensure consistency across all folders for files.
- **Implementation Tips:** Rename existing folders incrementally to match the new structure. Let me know if you’d like help with that process!
