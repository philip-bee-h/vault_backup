### General HPC System Administration

1. **Adam T. Harding**:
    
    - _What is the current distribution of resource managers (Slurm, SGE, LSF, PBS, etc.) across academic institutions?_
    - _How do institutions typically decide which scheduler or resource manager to adopt for their HPC clusters?_
    - _Are there any trends in resource manager adoption, particularly in terms of academic vs. research institutions?_
2. **General Question**:
    
    - _What are the best practices for managing and scaling HPC environments in mid-sized institutions?_
    - _How are HPC centers adapting to increasing resource demands from AI/ML/DL workloads?_

### Slurm & Container Integration

1. **Cody B. Johnson**:
    
    - _Is anyone using Slurm's container integration for software distribution and custom environments?_
    - _Can Slurm's container integration effectively manage complex dependencies in AI/ML/DL workflows?_
    - _What are some lessons learned from using Slurm with containerized environments? Any pitfalls or challenges?_
2. **Cody B. Johnson**:
    
    - _Are there any case studies or success stories around using containers (like Docker) in an HPC environment, especially for AI/ML/DL workloads?_
    - _How can institutions leverage containers to streamline software deployment and ensure reproducibility across environments?_
    - _What security concerns should we be aware of when using containers in HPC, particularly with regard to using the `--privileged` flag?_
3. **General Question**:
    
    - _How are institutions moving towards software-defined infrastructure in HPC environments, and what tools are being used to facilitate this transition?_
    - _Is there any notable progress or implementations of software-defined architectures in academic or research institutions?_

### Tools & Frameworks

4. **John C. Saxton**:
    
    - _Have any institutions used the [RGC tool](https://github.com/TACC/rgc) for containerizing software deployment and hiding software complexities from users?_
    - _Given that RGC hasn't been updated in years, are there newer frameworks or tools offering similar functionality for containerized environments in HPC?_
    - _What alternatives to RGC are available for managing containers as part of an HPC system without exposing them directly to users?_
5. **General Question**:
    
    - _How are HPC centers managing containers and ensuring security, particularly when providing access to users who may not be familiar with containerization?_
    - _Are there any tools or frameworks that specifically address container management in the context of AI/ML/DL research environments?_
    - What are people using for automation and spinning up puppet

### Challenges & Future Trends

6. **General Question**:
    
    - _What are the main challenges in managing software stacks for HPC environments, particularly when dealing with AI/ML/DL dependencies?_
    - _Are containers considered a better solution for dependency management compared to traditional module-based approaches in HPC environments?_
7. **General Question**:
    
    - _What are the emerging trends in HPC infrastructure that could impact academic institutions in the next 3-5 years?_
    - _How can mid-sized institutions better position themselves to keep up with the rapid evolution of workloads and technologies in the HPC space?_
