# Ansible Immediate To-Do List

## Basic Configuration

- Create `ansible.cfg` in your project root with basic settings _Why: Eliminates repetitive command-line options and standardizes your environment_
    
- Test running commands without the `-i` flag _Why: Confirms your configuration is working as expected_
    

## Variable Organization

- Create directory structure for variables (group_vars, host_vars) _Why: Centralizes variables and makes environment-specific configuration cleaner_
    
- Move common variables to appropriate files _Why: Reduces duplication and improves maintainability_
    
- Add environment-specific variables for different node types _Why: Allows customization without changing playbooks_
    

## Role Structure

- Create a basic "common" role for shared functionality _Why: Promotes code reuse and modularity_
    
- Move repetitive tasks into the role _Why: DRY principle - avoid repeating the same tasks in multiple playbooks_
    
- Create a site.yml playbook that uses your roles _Why: Provides a single entry point for applying configuration_
    

## Playbook Improvements

- Add tags to existing playbooks _Why: Enables selective execution of tasks for faster testing/debugging_
    
- Integrate bootstrap playbook with roles _Why: Standardizes your approach and reduces maintenance_
    

## Security and Secrets

- Set up Ansible Vault for sensitive information _Why: Securely stores passwords and keys in your repository_
    
- Reference vault variables in your regular configuration _Why: Keeps sensitive and non-sensitive configuration separate_
    

## Documentation and Testing

- Update your README with usage instructions _Why: Makes your repository more accessible to yourself and others_
    
- Create a test playbook for connectivity and basic validation _Why: Helps quickly verify infrastructure is accessible and properly configured_
    

Each of these improvements builds on the previous ones, gradually transforming your Ansible setup into a more maintainable, secure, and professional configuration.
