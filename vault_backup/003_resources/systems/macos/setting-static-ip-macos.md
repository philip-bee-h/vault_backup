When configuring a PC to connect with a new network switch that has default settings (like an IP of `192.168.0.239` and a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`), you'll need to ensure your computer is set to a compatible static IP address within the same subnet but not the same as the switch's IP. Here’s how you can do that on a macOS machine:

### Setting Up a Compatible Static IP on macOS

1. **Open System Preferences**:
   - Click on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen.
   - Select "System Preferences."

2. **Go to Network**:
   - Click on "Network" in the System Preferences window.

3. **Select the Appropriate Interface**:
   - Click on the network interface you plan to use (such as Ethernet if you’re connecting via cable).

4. **Configure the IP Settings Manually**:
   - Click the "Configure IPv4" dropdown and select "Manually."
   - Set the "IP Address" to something in the `192.168.0.x` range, where x is between 1 and 238 or 240 to 254 (e.g., `192.168.0.10`).
   - Set the "Subnet Mask" to `255.255.255.0`.
   - The "Router" (gateway) field can usually be left blank if you’re directly connecting to the switch without going through another router.

5. **Apply and Confirm Changes**:
   - Click "Apply" to save the settings.
   - Close the Network settings.

### Testing the Configuration

After setting the static IP:
- **Confirm the Settings**: Open the Terminal and type `ifconfig` to verify that your IP settings are applied correctly.
- **Test Connectivity**: Try pinging the switch’s default IP (`192.168.0.239`) to ensure you can reach it. You can do this by typing `ping 192.168.0.239` in the Terminal.

### Additional Notes

- **Network Isolation**: When your computer is configured with this static IP, it may not be able to reach other networks, including the internet, if it’s a direct connection to the switch without additional routing.
- **Documentation**: Keep a record of these settings, especially if you might need to revert to DHCP or another network configuration later.

This setup will allow you to communicate directly with the switch to perform initial configurations or other necessary setup tasks without the need for DHCP or discovery utilities.
