### CAM Asset Tagging

- Outstanding asset tags remain from a previous administrator's tenure.
    
- Tasks include:
    
    - Locating purchase orders (POs)
        
    - Identifying physical location of equipment
        
    - Tagging and documenting serial numbers
        
    - Reporting back to CAM via email
        

### Decommissioning LSS Nodes

- Assess how many nodes are pending decommissioning
    
- Develop a plan for secure and orderly retirement of systems
    

### Comprehensive Inventory Tracking

- **IDAS:** Inventory complete
    
- **Argon:** Inventory in progress
    
- **Storage:** Partially documented in the internal wiki
    
- Need to select and implement a central inventory system
    
    - **NetBox** is the leading candidate due to:
        
        - IP address management capabilities
            
        - Integration potential with existing workflows
            
    - Tasks include standing up the system and inputting inventory data
        

### Outstanding Argon RMAs

## Summary

The current workload reflects a mix of:

- Legacy technical debt
    
- Active hardware lifecycle management
    
- Critical system support and troubleshooting
    
- Inventory and documentation improvement efforts
    

The scale and complexity of these tasks—especially hardware failures and support for Argon—justify additional staffing to maintain reliability, accelerate progress, and support future growth.
