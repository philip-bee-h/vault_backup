## Samba Setup Preparation - Server Tracking Notes

#### **Environment Information**

- **Server Name:** `vm-samba-ubu`
- **Disk Information:**
    - `/dev/sda` - 40GB, mounted as `/`
    - `/dev/vda` - 4.5TB, used for media storage

#### **Steps Performed**

1. **Verify Samba Installation:**

```bash
whereis samba
```

- Output confirms Samba binary and configuration paths.

1. **Check Disks and Partitions:**

```bash
lsblk
sudo fdisk -l
```

- Identified `vda` as the target disk for media storage.

1. **Partitioning the Disk (`/dev/vda`):**

- Used `fdisk` to create a new **GPT partition**:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/vda
```

Steps:
	- Created a new GPT disklabel.
	- Added a single partition (`vda1`) spanning the entire disk (4.5TB).
	- Saved and exited.
1. **Formatting the Partition:**

- Formatted `vda1` as `ext4`:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vda1
```

5. **Mounting the Partition:**

- Created a directory for mounting:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /srv/media
```

- Mounted the partition:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/vda1 /srv/media
```

- Verified the mount:

```bash
df -h | grep /srv/media
```

6. **Persistent Mount Configuration:**

- Retrieved the UUID of the partition:

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/vda1
```

Example Output:

```
UUID="b0842866-b465-4f86-bc1a-b095f0480395"
```

- Edited `/etc/fstab` to include:

```
UUID=b0842866-b465-4f86-bc1a-b095f0480395 /srv/media ext4 defaults 0 2
```

- Applied the configuration:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

7. **Verification:**

- Verified the partition is mounted:

```bash
df -h | grep /srv/media
```

- Created and removed a test file to confirm write access:

```bash
sudo touch /srv/media/testfile
sudo rm /srv/media/testfile
```

- Checked directory contents:

```bash
ls -l /srv/media
```
#### **Post-Setup Notes**

- The disk is now mounted persistently at `/srv/media` with `ext4` filesystem.
- Ready for Samba configuration to share `/srv/media`.

## **Steps to Create a Passwordless Samba Share**

### **1. Verify the Shared Directory**

1. Ensure the directory you want to share exists (youâ€™ve already set this up as `/srv/media`):

```bash
ls -ld /srv/media
```

If the directory does not exist, create it:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /srv/media
```

1. Set permissions for open access:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 /srv/media
```

- **Note**: `777` grants full read, write, and execute permissions for all users. This is suitable for a trusted homelab but not recommended in a production environment.

---

### **2. Configure Samba for Guest Access**

Edit the Samba configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Add the following section at the bottom of the file:

```ini
[MediaShare]
    comment = Media Share for Plex and Ripping
    path = /srv/media
    browseable = yes
    read only = no
    guest ok = yes
    create mask = 0777
    directory mask = 0777
    force user = nobody
```

**Explanation of Key Parameters:**

- **`guest ok = yes`**: Allows unauthenticated (guest) access.
- **`read only = no`**: Enables write access.
- **`force user = nobody`**: Ensures all created files are owned by the `nobody` user for consistency.
- **`create mask` and `directory mask`**: Ensures new files and directories have full permissions.

Save and exit the editor (`Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl + X`).

---

### **3. Restart the Samba Service**

To apply the new configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

---

### **4. Update Firewall Rules**

Allow Samba traffic through your firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow samba
```

Verify the rule is active:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

---

### **5. Mount the Share on Your Media Ripping Station and Plex Server**

On both systems, mount the Samba share with the following command:

```bash
sudo mount -t cifs //<server-ip>/MediaShare /mnt/media -o guest,uid=1000,gid=1000
```

Replace:

- `<server-ip>`: The IP address of your Samba server.
- `/mnt/media`: The local mount point on your client machine.

If the mount point (`/mnt/media`) does not exist on the client machine, create it:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/media
```

---

### **6. Make the Mount Persistent (Optional)**

To mount the share automatically at boot on your ripping station and Plex server, add this line to `/etc/fstab` on each client machine:

```plaintext
//<server-ip>/MediaShare /mnt/media cifs guest,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0
```

Test the `/etc/fstab` configuration:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

---

### **Security Note**

This setup allows anyone on your local network to access the share without a password. While convenient for a homelab, it may expose your data if your network is not properly secured. Consider implementing authentication if you expand your network or require tighter controls.

This setup will allow your media ripping station and Plex server to access the share without any issues. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸš€
