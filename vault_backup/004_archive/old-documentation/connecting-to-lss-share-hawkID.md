### Issue
When users experience issues logging in to and accessing the SMB LSS share, it is usually caused by macOS trying to use outdated credentials stored in the system cache. This issue occurs despite deleting the share credentials cached in the keychain, as they might be stored elsewhere, possibly involving Kerberos. This problem often arises after a recent password change.

### Solution
To ensure macOS uses the updated credentials for the SMB share, follow these steps:

1. **Clear Cached Credentials**:
	- **Open Keychain Access**:
		- Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight search.
		- Type `Keychain Access` and press `Enter`.
		- In the Keychain Access window, select the `login` keychain from the sidebar.
	- **Locate and Delete Server Credentials**:
		- In the search bar at the top right, type the server name (e.g., `smb` or the specific server address).
		- Right-click on the relevant entry and select `Delete`.
	- **Reboot the Mac**:
		- Click the Apple menu in the top left corner.
		- Select `Restart` and confirm.

2. **Refresh Credential Cache**:
	- Rebooting the Mac will refresh the credential cache, ensuring that macOS will not try to connect to the SMB share using old cached credentials.

3. **Remap the Server with Updated Credentials**:
	- **Open Finder**:
		- Click on the Finder icon in the Dock.
		- Navigate to the top menu and select `Go` > `Connect to Server`.
- **Enter the Server Address**:
	- In the `Server Address` field, type the following URL:
```
smb://someuser:*@<serverName>.hpc.uiowa.edu
```
- Replace `<serverName>` with the actual server name.
- **Authenticate**:
	- When prompted, select `Connect As: Registered User`.
	- Enter the following details:
		- **Username**: `hawkID@iowa.uiowa.edu`
		- **Password**: Enter your HawkID password.
- **Connect**:
	- Click `Connect` to establish a connection to the server.
