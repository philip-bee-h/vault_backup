If you prefer a more standardized naming convention without themes, we can focus on function and purpose for a clean, descriptive setup. Here’s how it might look:

### **Naming Convention Format**
- **`[Prefix]`** - Type of device
- **`[Function]`** - Primary role or service
- **`[Optional Suffix]`** - Distinguishes similar devices

#### **Device Types and Suggested Prefixes**
- **pve** - Proxmox Environment
- **vm** - Virtual Machines
- **pi** - Raspberry Pi (for light services or monitoring)
- **ws** - Workstation
- **svr** - Server
- **stor** - Storage-related devices
- **net** - Network devices (if needed later)

#### **Function Descriptors**
- **prod** - Production environment
- **dev** - Development environment
- **arr** - Media-related (ARR stack, e.g., for media organization)
- **mon** - Monitoring (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus, etc.)
- **media** - Specific to media handling (e.g., ripping or Plex)

#### **Example Devices and Names**
Here’s how your devices might be named with this scheme:

| Type           | Prefix     | Function | Example         | Description                             |
|----------------|------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Proxmox Prod   | `pve`      | `prod`   | `pve-prod`      | Main Proxmox production environment     |
| Proxmox Dev    | `pve`      | `dev`    | `pve-dev`       | Development/test Proxmox environment    |
| Proxmox ARR    | `pve`      | `arr`    | `pve-arr`       | ARR stack for media services            |
| Raspberry Pi   | `pi`       | `mon`    | `pi-mon`        | Raspberry Pi for monitoring             |
| Workstation    | `ws`       | `daily`  | `ws-daily`      | Primary daily workstation               |
| Workstation (Media) | `ws`  | `media`  | `ws-media`      | Workstation for media processing/ripping|

#### **Structure Recap**
This format keeps it straightforward:
- **Device Prefix** (`pve`, `pi`, `ws`)
- **Function** (`prod`, `dev`, `arr`, `mon`, `daily`, `media`)
- **Suffix** if needed for additional distinction (e.g., `prod-01`, `prod-02`).

### **Naming Guide Summary**
| Device           | Suggested Name |
|------------------|----------------|
| Proxmox Prod     | `pve-prod`     |
| Proxmox Dev      | `pve-dev`      |
| Proxmox ARR Stack| `pve-arr`      |
| Monitoring Pi    | `pi-mon`       |
| Daily Workstation| `ws-daily`     |
| Media Workstation| `ws-media`     |

This approach makes it easy to expand by adding functions or suffixes without themed names, focusing purely on utility and clarity. Let me know if you'd like to modify or add more roles!

## Star Wars planets 
- Grouped by potential device or function roles, based on their notable characteristics in the Star Wars universe. 
- Each group can align with specific functions, device types, or environments.

This breakdown provides a thematic basis for assigning Star Wars planet names to various functions, while still keeping the names relevant to their purpose in your setup. Let me know if you’d like to adjust any categories or groupings!

## Examples
Here’s how the full naming structure might look with this approach:

1. **Primary Production Server:** `pve-prod-coruscant`
2. **Development Server:** `pve-dev-dagobah`
3. **ARR Stack Server:** `pve-arr-mustafar`
4. **Monitoring Pi:** `pi-mon-yavin`
5. **Workstation for Daily Use:** `ws-daily-kashyyyk`
6. **Media Storage Server:** `stor-media-scarif`
