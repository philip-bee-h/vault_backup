# **DevOps Documentation Guide: Write Docs That Actually Help Your Team**

## **Purpose**

This guide outlines how to write effective, helpful DevOps (or any technical) documentation that saves time, reduces errors, and supports team collaboration.

---

## **1. Why DevOps Documentation Matters**

### Common Risks of Poor Documentation

- Knowledge loss when key engineers leave
    
- Increased time to resolve incidents
    
- Bottlenecks during onboarding and handoffs
    

### Benefits of Good Documentation

- **Faster onboarding** of new team members
    
- **Reduced downtime** during incidents
    
- **Standardized workflows** and troubleshooting
    
- **Improved collaboration** across teams (Dev, Ops, Security)
    

---

## **2. Characteristics of Good DevOps Documentation**

A good document should be:

- **Clear** – Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
    
- **Concise** – Stick to relevant details
    
- **Up-to-date** – Regularly reviewed and version-controlled
    
- **Accessible** – Easy to find and well-organized
    
- **Actionable** – Includes steps, commands, and examples

## **3. Types of DevOps Documentation**

### a. **Runbooks (How-to Guides)**

**Purpose:** Step-by-step guides for routine operational tasks.

**Example Use Case:** Restarting a Kubernetes pod.

**Example Format:**

```markdown
# How to Restart a Kubernetes Pod

1. Run `kubectl get pods` to list all pods.
2. Identify the pod you want to restart.
3. Run `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>` to delete the pod.
4. Kubernetes will automatically restart it.
5. Run `kubectl get pods` to verify it's back online.
```

---

### b. **Incident Reports (Postmortems)**

**Purpose:** Capture lessons learned from outages or failures.

**Example Format:**

```markdown
# Incident Report: Database Outage on 2024-03-10

**What happened?**
- Database connection failed at 2:00 AM due to high memory usage.

**Impact**
- The website was down for 45 minutes.

**Resolution**
- Increased DB memory allocation
- Enabled auto-scaling on DB pods

**Prevention**
- Set up memory usage monitoring and alerts
```

---

### c. **Infrastructure Documentation**

**Purpose:** Describe your cloud and on-prem architecture.

**Include:**

- Network and cloud diagrams
    
- Terraform, Helm, and Kubernetes manifests
    
- Security policies and IAM roles
    
- VPC, subnet, and DNS structure
    

---

### d. **CI/CD Pipeline Documentation**

**Purpose:** Explain how code moves from dev to production.

**Include:**

- Branching strategy
    
- Automated testing workflows
    
- Build and deployment steps
    
- Rollback instructions
    

---

## **4. Writing Style Guidelines**

### 1) **Write Like You're Explaining to a New Hire**

- ❌ “Initialize the infra setup via custom bootstrap.”
    
- ✅ “Run `bash setup.sh` to initialize the infrastructure.”
    

### 2) **Use Code Blocks and Terminal Commands**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n my-namespace
```

### 3) **Use Diagrams and Screenshots**

- Show diagrams for architecture or CI/CD pipelines
    
- Add screenshots for UI-based tools or dashboards
    

### 4) **Keep It Short and Actionable**

- Aim for less than 1 page per runbook or task
    
- Use bullets, numbered lists, and checklists
    

### 5) **Update Regularly**

- Assign owners to review docs quarterly
    
- Link documentation updates to release cycles

## **5. Where to Store Documentation**

|Type|Recommended Location|
|---|---|
|General Docs|Confluence, Notion, GitHub Wiki|
|Project-Specific Guides|`README.md` in Git repos|
|Runbooks|Centralized Git repo (e.g. `runbooks.git`)|
|Infra & Pipelines|MkDocs, Backstage, or similar dashboard|

## **7. Key Takeaways**

- Write for humans, not just experts.
    
- Use command examples, diagrams, and real-world scenarios.
    
- Keep it organized, updated, and searchable.
    
- Invest in documentation now to avoid chaos later.
