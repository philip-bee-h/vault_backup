## Description
This knowledge base article provides a detailed procedure for granting team members access to LSS shares at the University of Iowa. The process involves using the Access Management web portal to assign user permissions to specific shares.

## Prerequisites
- **Access Rights**: You must have administrative rights to modify access settings for LSS shares.
- **HawkID**: All team members requiring access must have an active HawkID.
- **VPN Connection**: Ensure you are connected to the University's VPN if accessing the management portal from off-campus.

## Step-by-Step Procedure
1. **Open the Access Management Portal**:
	- Navigate to the [Access Management portal](https://iam.uiowa.edu/access) on the University of Iowa website.
2. **Locate the Share**:
	- Use the search function to find the specific share by entering the share name.
3. **Modify Settings**:
	- Click on the settings icon (gear icon) next to the share name to access its settings.
4. **Assign Ownership**:
	- Assign yourself as an owner if not already designated, which allows you to manage access permissions.
5. **Add Users**:
	- With ownership rights, click the 'Add' button to begin adding users.
	- Enter the HawkID of the user you wish to add.
	- If the search returns both a HawkID and a healthcareID, add both to ensure proper access across systems.
6. **Notify the User**:
	- After adding a user, send a notification to inform them of the access.
	- Confirm that they have received the instructions on how to mount the share and can access it successfully.

## Troubleshooting
- **User Cannot Access Share**:
	- **Check User IDs**: Verify that both the HawkID and healthcareID were added if applicable.
	- **Review Permissions**: Ensure the user has the correct permissions set for their needs.
	- **VPN Issues**: Confirm that the user is connected to the Universityâ€™s VPN if accessing from off-campus.
- **Access Denied Errors**:
	- **Revalidate Rights**: Ensure that your administrative rights to manage the share are active and have not been revoked.
	- **Session Timeout**: If the session times out, log back into the portal and attempt the procedure again.
