### NOTES


Sure, here's a more consolidated task list:

### Disk Issue Troubleshooting Tasks

1. **Inspect and Re-seat the Disk**
   - Pull the disk from the server.
   - Check the disk for any physical damage or issues.
   - Re-seat the disk back into its original slot.

2. **Test the Disk**
   - Check if the disk is operational after re-seating.

3. **Move the Disk to a Different Slot**
   - If the disk isn't working, place it in a different empty slot.
   - Ensure there are no pinched leads when moving the disk.

4. **Report Errors**
   - If the disk still fails to work, send the error details to Simech with a message indicating the drive won't spin up.
