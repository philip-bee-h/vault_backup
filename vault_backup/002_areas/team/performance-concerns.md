### Performance Concerns

#### Overview

Over the course of Deandre’s time with our team, I have encountered several recurring performance and conduct issues that have impacted productivity and team efficiency. Below is a summary of the key concerns:

---

### Task Execution and Attention to Detail

- **Repeated Errors:** Each time work is assigned to Deandre, I find myself needing to re-explain processes due to recurring mistakes and a lack of attention to detail.
    
- **Ticket Closure:** Disk swap tasks were initiated but tickets were not being closed out. Despite coaching on this issue, I have continued to find tickets left incomplete and have had to close them out myself.
    
- **Incomplete Procedures:** On one occasion, Deandre asked for verification on a task he had completed incorrectly. It was later discovered he had skipped the first portion of the process.
    
- **Failure to Follow Documentation:** Instead of using the official documentation, Deandre has relied on outdated personal notes, which has led to errors.
    
- **Incorrect ACLs:** Deandre applied incorrect ACLs due to command typos. Although the command failed, it had the potential to be applied system-wide, which could have caused broader issues.
    

---

### Communication and Team Engagement

- **Lack of Communication:** Deandre frequently fails to notify the team when arriving late or when working from home.
    
- **Lack of Initiative During Issues:** During a recent incident, instead of assisting the team with troubleshooting, he chose to sit at a desk and use his phone, disengaged from the task.
    
- **Distraction and Follow-through:** Deandre often appears distracted. While he listens during instructions, he has difficulty adhering to them consistently.
    
- **Team Meetings:** He either does not join scheduled meetings or joins without turning on his camera and does not actively participate.
    

---

### Supervision and Workload Impact

- **Increased Oversight Required:** Rather than being a force multiplier, Deandre’s presence has become a burden on team productivity. I frequently have to review and correct his work due to incomplete documentation and missing task details.
    
- **Example – Disk Swaps:** Several disk swap tickets were left open without documentation. There were no box numbers listed, and the photos attached to the tickets were incorrect. I had to spend an entire afternoon verifying which disks were sent to which servers, as Deandre was unable to recall how many packages had been shipped. His lack of attention and follow-through during this process either did or nearly resulted in a financial loss for the department.

### Training and Development

- Deandre has received training from multiple team members, including Genevieve, Brian, and Philip. Despite this, he continues to require step-by-step explanations and close supervision to avoid errors in production environments.
    

---

### Summary

While Deandre has been given multiple opportunities for guidance and correction, his ongoing performance issues, lack of attention to detail, and failure to follow established procedures continue to impact the team’s effectiveness. At this time, the level of oversight required outweighs the value he adds to the team.
