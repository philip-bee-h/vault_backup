## Description
Work prioritization within RS as described by Cody J in a team meeting with my group of new hires

### **Work Prioritization Guidelines**

1. **Work Stoppage (Highest Priority)**  
   - Issues causing complete outages or stoppages in critical systems or workflows.  
   - Immediate attention is required to minimize impact on operations or users.

2. **Work Slowdown**  
   - Problems leading to reduced system performance, delayed workflows, or inefficiencies.  
   - Address promptly to restore optimal functionality and prevent escalation.

3. **User-Facing Issues**  
   - Requests or issues reported directly by end-users.  
   - Prioritize based on severity, scope of impact, and potential for affecting user productivity.
